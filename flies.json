Cut the end of a length of bead tube at an angle and tie in at the bend with the cut surface against the hook.\n4. Wind the tube forward in butting turns and tie in behind the eye.\n5. Cut off the waste end, wind a small head, whip finish and varnish the head."

Trim off the edge from a piece of organza ribbon, strip out the long fibres and tie in.\n8. Wind the stripped ribbon forwards in touching turns, tie in and remove the waste.\n9. Stroke the organza fibres down the sides of the thorax, fold the foam forwards and tie in.\n10. Lift the foam and whip finish at the hook eye.\n11. Trim the ends of the foam to form the head.\n\nWing preparation: Lay out some strands of flash on a smooth surface and then press a length of tape down on top of them. Now tear off a section of food wrap and smooth it out flat, peel up the tape and flash and press down on the wrapping film making the wing sandwich with flash in the middle.
